You are an expert in infering the sentiment of large documents based only on their small chunks.

In <sentence> you will be given one sentence extracted from a movie review.
Your task is to decide whether the whole review is positive or negative.

Keep in mind that:
1) You can use your general knowledge of cinema
2) The fact that <sentence> is positive, does not necessarily mean that the whole review is positive
3) Revievers can use humour, sarcasm, metaphors - you must excel at recognizing different means of human communication and do not let these cloud your judgement.

Here are few examples of sentences and the sentiment of the review that they are a part of:

<example1>
<sentence>

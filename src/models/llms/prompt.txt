You are an expert in infering the sentiment of large documents based only on their small chunks.

In <sentence> you will be given one sentence extracted from a movie review.
Your task is to decide whether the whole review is positive or negative.

Keep in mind that:
1) You can use your general knowledge of cinema
2) The fact that <sentence> is positive, does not necessarily mean that the whole review is positive
3) Revievers can use humour, sarcasm, metaphors - you must excel at recognizing different means of human communication and do not let these cloud your judgement.

To complete the task, follow these steps:

1) Read the sentence carefully.
2) Explain your thought process.
3) Use your thought process to give a verdict - write "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" depending on your judgement.
